# Technical Context: Video Subtitling Tool

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
1. **Python 3.x**
   - Primary programming language
   - Used for the CLI interface and orchestration

2. **Whisper**
   - OpenAI's speech recognition system
   - Used for transcribing German audio to text
   - Provides translation capabilities from German to English
   - Command-line interface available

3. **FFmpeg**
   - Multimedia framework for handling video and audio
   - Used for extracting audio from video files
   - Used for embedding subtitles into video files
   - Provides extensive video processing capabilities

### Python Libraries
1. **argparse**
   - For parsing command-line arguments
   - Provides help text and usage information

2. **subprocess**
   - For executing Whisper and FFmpeg commands
   - Manages external process execution

3. **tempfile**
   - For creating and managing temporary files
   - Ensures proper cleanup after processing

4. **pathlib**
   - For cross-platform path handling
   - Simplifies file operations

5. **logging**
   - For structured logging
   - Helps with debugging and error reporting

## Development Setup
- Python 3.x installed
- Whisper installed and accessible from command line
- FFmpeg installed and accessible from command line
- No additional virtual environment required if dependencies are met

## Technical Constraints
1. **Whisper Limitations**
   - Accuracy depends on audio quality
   - Processing time increases with longer videos
   - Requires significant CPU/GPU resources for larger models

2. **FFmpeg Considerations**
   - Complex command-line syntax
   - Needs to be properly configured for subtitle embedding
   - Performance depends on video resolution and format

3. **System Requirements**
   - Sufficient disk space for temporary files
   - Adequate CPU/memory for processing
   - Compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Dependencies
- **Whisper CLI**
  - Version: Latest available
  - Usage: `whisper [options] audio_file`
  - Key options:
    - `--task translate`: For translation
    - `--language de`: Specify German as source
    - `--output_format srt`: Generate SRT subtitles

- **FFmpeg**
  - Version: 4.x or later
  - Usage: `ffmpeg [options] -i input_file output_file`
  - Key options:
    - `-vf "subtitles=file:force_style='options'"`: For subtitle embedding
    - `-c:a copy`: To preserve audio quality

## Integration Points
1. **Input**: Video files (primarily MP4 format)
2. **Intermediate**: Audio extraction (WAV format)
3. **Processing**: Whisper transcription/translation
4. **Intermediate**: Subtitle file (SRT format)
5. **Output**: Video with embedded subtitles (MP4 format)

## Technical Decisions
1. Using Whisper's built-in translation capabilities rather than separate translation service
2. Generating SRT format for maximum compatibility
3. Using FFmpeg's subtitle filter for embedding rather than muxing
4. Creating a new output file rather than modifying the original
5. Using temporary files for intermediate steps to maintain clean workflow
