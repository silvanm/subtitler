# Active Context: Video Subtitling Tool

## Current Work Focus
We have developed a Python command-line tool that adds English subtitles to videos with non-English audio in various languages. The tool:

1. Takes a video file as input
2. Extracts the audio using FFmpeg
3. Uses Whisper to transcribe and translate the audio from the specified language to English
4. Generates an SRT subtitle file
5. Uses FFmpeg to embed the subtitles into the video
6. Outputs a new video file with the embedded subtitles

## Recent Changes
- Completed implementation of all core components
- Created modular architecture with separate components for each processing step
- Implemented robust error handling and logging
- Added command-line interface with various customization options
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Added support for multiple source languages via the `-l/--language` command-line option
- Prepared project for GitHub publication:
  - Updated README.md with badges, better installation instructions, and examples
  - Added proper MIT LICENSE file
  - Created CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
  - Enhanced .gitignore for Python projects
  - Updated setup.py with better metadata and development dependencies

## Active Decisions
1. **Whisper Configuration**:
   - Using `--task translate` for direct translation to English
   - Using `--language` parameter to specify the source language (default: German)
   - Added command-line option `-l/--language` to allow users to specify different source languages
   - Using `--output_format srt` to generate subtitle files

2. **FFmpeg Configuration**:
   - Using subtitle filter for embedding subtitles
   - Positioning subtitles in the lower third, centered
   - Creating a new output file rather than modifying the original

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Modular design with separate components for each processing step
   - Using temporary files for intermediate outputs
   - Implementing robust error handling and cleanup

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing with longer videos and various audio qualities
2. Test error handling scenarios
3. Gather user feedback and make improvements
4. Test with various source languages to verify accuracy and performance
5. Consider additional features:
   - Batch processing of multiple videos
   - Custom subtitle styling options
   - GUI interface
6. Optimize performance for longer videos
7. Publish to GitHub and promote the project
8. Consider publishing to PyPI for easier installation

## Current Considerations
- Initial testing with a short video clip was successful
- The tool correctly transcribed and translated audio to English
- Subtitles were properly embedded in the video with good readability
- Further testing is needed with longer videos and various audio qualities
- Whisper's accuracy may vary depending on audio quality, accent, and source language
- Processing time for longer videos could be significant
- The tool now supports multiple source languages for translation to English
- Users need to have both FFmpeg and Whisper installed
- Testing with different languages is needed to verify accuracy across languages
- The project is now ready for GitHub publication with proper documentation and license
- Example videos are available in the examples directory for testing
