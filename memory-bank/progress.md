## Current Status
- **Planning Phase**: Completed
- **Implementation Phase**: Completed
- **Testing Phase**: Not started
- **Documentation Phase**: Completed
- **GitHub Preparation Phase**: Completed

## What Works
- Project requirements and architecture defined
- Technical approach determined
- Documentation structure established
- Core functionality implemented
- Command-line interface created
- Audio extraction from video
- Transcription and translation with Whisper
- Support for multiple source languages
- Subtitle embedding with FFmpeg
- Error handling and logging

## What's Left to Build

### Core Components
- [x] CLI Interface (main.py)
- [x] Audio Extraction Module (audio.py)
- [x] Transcription Module (transcribe.py)
- [x] Subtitle Formatting Module (subtitles.py)
- [x] Video Processing Module (video.py)
- [x] Utilities Module (utils.py)

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Implement command-line argument parsing
- [x] Create audio extraction functionality
- [x] Integrate Whisper for transcription/translation
- [x] Implement subtitle formatting
- [x] Integrate FFmpeg for subtitle embedding
- [x] Add error handling and logging
- [x] Implement temporary file management
- [x] Create user feedback mechanisms
- [x] Add support for multiple source languages

### Testing Tasks
- [x] Test with short video clips
- [ ] Test with longer videos
- [ ] Test with various audio qualities
- [ ] Test with different source languages
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing

### Documentation Tasks
- [x] Create project brief
- [x] Document system architecture
- [x] Document technical approach
- [x] Create user documentation
- [x] Add code documentation
- [x] Prepare GitHub documentation (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING)

### GitHub Preparation Tasks
- [x] Update README.md with badges and better documentation
- [x] Create proper MIT LICENSE file
- [x] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- [x] Enhance .gitignore for Python projects
- [x] Update setup.py with better metadata and development dependencies

## Known Issues
- Not tested with real videos yet
- May need adjustments based on real-world testing

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Test with videos in various languages (German, French, Spanish, etc.)
2. Optimize performance if needed
3. Add additional features based on user feedback
4. Publish to GitHub and promote the project
5. Consider publishing to PyPI for easier installation

## Timeline
- Planning Phase: Completed
- Implementation Phase: Completed
- Testing Phase: To be started
- Documentation Phase: Completed
- GitHub Preparation Phase: Completed
- Publication Phase: Ready to start
